 <p style="width:50%;">Hello, I'm a 17 year old highschool student who's attending Mustang High School.
  Im currently a senior this year. One of my favorite subjects would be mathamatics such as algebra and calculus.   </p>

  <h1>Hobbies & Goals</h1>
  <p> Besides from working all the time and going to class I have many interests and activities I do in my free time. I enjoy watching action movies, especially Marvel. I go on morning walks, sightseeing, and exploring different places here in Oklahoma. When I'm free on the afternoons I try to spend as much time with my younger siblings while I still can. Im an adventurous and outgoing person who's ready to embark any adventure. Another hobby of mine would be listening to music all the time, in the car, sleeping, working, and cleaning.  While having many hobbies, I also have many goals academically and in life. I plan on completing this program throughout this year and next year. While completing my program, I also plan on obtaining honor roll in my school. As well as attending OCCC next year. Another goal I have is figuring out what major I'll be studying for and what type of degree. A personal goal of mine would be to continue to drink a gallon of water everyday as well as continue to eat more nutritious meals rather than junk food.       </p>
