  <br>
 <p style="width:50%;"> CAS is one of my favorite bands; playing indie, slow beat, and majestic songs. The band consists of Greg Gonzalez, Philip Tubbs, and Randy Miller. Greg is the vocalist, wereas Phillip plays the keyboard, and Randy plays the bass. They're on tour at the moment but unfortuantly all their concerts are sold out, but I do plan on going in the future.
